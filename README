Campfire Bot Readme
===================

This is a first pass at a campfire bot, which will has rudimentary support for commands; with 'tweet' being the only command support at this time.

Directories
===========

config/
  Environment configuration files

lib/
  Add commands here

log/
  Log files based on the environment name

spec/
  rspec's home

Getting Started
===============

1) Copy the twitter.yml.example file to twitter.yml
2) Edit the file and add the appropriate settings
3) Copy the campfire.yml.example file to campfire.yml
4) Edit the file and add the appropriate settings

Contributions
=============

I'd love help.  Here's some ideas I'm planning to work on:

* Finish support for multiple commands, adding convenient rake tasks for generating new ones
* Add reconnect support
* Post information back to campfire (errors, etc.)
